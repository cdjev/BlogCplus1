Key Points
Use a Hario V60 dripper with a filter, grind coffee to medium-coarse, and use a 1:15 to 1:17 coffee-to-water ratio.
Rinse the filter, add coffee, bloom with water equal to coffee weight, then pour remaining water slowly over 3-4 minutes.
Serve and enjoy, adjusting grind and technique for taste.
Equipment Needed
You'll need a Hario V60 dripper, filter papers, a gooseneck kettle for precision, a kitchen scale, a timer, and a mug or server. While a gooseneck kettle is ideal, a standard kettle works too. Freshly ground coffee is recommended for better flavor, but pre-ground is okay.
Step-by-Step Guide
Prepare the Filter: Fold the filter, place it in the V60, and rinse with hot water to remove paper taste and preheat. Discard the rinse water.
Grind the Coffee: Grind to medium-coarse, like sea salt. Use 20 grams of coffee for 300 grams of water as a starting point.
Set Up: Place V60 on a cup, add coffee, and level it by shaking.
Bloom the Coffee: Heat water to 200°F (94°C). Pour 20 grams of water over 20 grams of coffee, let sit for 30-45 seconds.
Pour Remaining Water: Pour the rest (280 grams) in circles, starting center, over 3-4 minutes total from bloom start.
Serve: Remove V60, swirl coffee, and enjoy. Adjust grind finer for stronger, coarser for weaker taste.
Surprising Detail: Bloom Water Variation
It's surprising how much bloom water varies—some guides use water equal to coffee weight, others up to five times, affecting extraction. Stick to equal weight for balance.
Comprehensive Guide to Using the Hario V60 for Optimal Coffee Brewing
The Hario V60 is a popular pour-over coffee brewer known for its ability to produce a clean, flavorful cup, thanks to its unique 60-degree cone shape, spiral ribs, and large drainage hole. This guide provides a detailed, step-by-step process for brewing with the V60, catering to both beginners and enthusiasts, and includes variations observed across multiple sources to ensure a thorough understanding.
Background and Equipment
The Hario V60, introduced by Hario Co., Ltd., is designed for manual pour-over brewing, offering flexibility in flavor through its conical shape and ribbed design, which enhances water flow and extraction. To brew properly, you'll need:
Hario V60 Dripper: Available in sizes 01 (1-2 cups, ~10oz max), 02 (1-4 cups, ~20oz, standard), and 03 (1-6 cups, ~30oz), made from plastic, ceramic, glass, metal, or copper (Hario UK Drippers).
Filter Papers: Specific to V60, available untabbed or tabbed, with options for light, medium, or dark roasts (Smiling Coffee Snob Filters, Hario UK Filters).
Coffee Grinder: Manual or electric, with medium-coarse grind recommended (like sea salt), e.g., Baratza Encore at setting 16 (Low Key Coffee Snobs Grinder Review).
Gooseneck Kettle: Preferred for precision pouring, though standard kettles work (Bean Box Gooseneck).
Kitchen Scale and Timer: Essential for accuracy, e.g., Hario V60-Brand Drip Coffee Scale and Timer (Low Key Coffee Snobs Scale).
Mug or Server: To collect the brewed coffee, e.g., Hario V60 Range Server 600ml (Whole Latte Love Server).
Freshly roasted coffee is recommended for optimal flavor, though pre-ground is acceptable if fresh grinding isn't possible.
Step-by-Step Brewing Process
The following steps outline a standard method, with variations noted from multiple sources for flexibility. For a typical single serve, use 20 grams of coffee and 300 grams of water (1:15 ratio), though ratios from 1:15 to 1:17 are common.
Prepare the Filter:
Fold the filter paper at the seam to form a cone, insert into the V60, and place on your mug or server.
Rinse the filter with hot water (about 300 grams, as per Driftaway Coffee) to remove paper taste and preheat the brewer. Discard the rinse water to ensure no dilution.
Grind the Coffee:
Grind the coffee to a medium-coarse consistency, similar to sea salt, to balance extraction time and flavor. For example, use setting 16 on a Baratza Encore (Low Key Coffee Snobs).
Use 20 grams of coffee for a standard serve, though sources vary: 15-30g (Sample Coffee Roasters), 18g (Low Key Coffee Snobs), or 25g (Whole Latte Love).
Set Up the Brewer:
Place the V60 on your cup or server, ensuring stability.
Add the ground coffee to the filter, then level the bed by gently shaking or using a stirring tool (e.g., chopstick, as in Smiling Coffee Snob) to ensure even extraction.
Bloom the Coffee:
Heat water to around 200°F (94°C), though ranges from 195-205°F (Driftaway Coffee) or just off boil (88°C for dark roasts, Smiling Coffee Snob) are noted.
Pour a small amount of water for the bloom phase, typically equal to the coffee weight (20g for 20g coffee, as per this guide), though sources vary: 25-30g for 30g coffee (Driftaway Coffee), 50-90g for 18g coffee (Low Key Coffee Snobs), or 1 mL per gram (25mL for 25g, Whole Latte Love). This guide recommends 20g for 20g coffee for balance.
Pour in concentric circles, starting from the center, to ensure even saturation. Let sit for 30-45 seconds to allow CO2 to escape, visible as bubbling if using freshly roasted coffee.
Pour the Remaining Water:
After the bloom, pour the remaining water (280g for our example, 300g total - 20g bloom) in a slow, controlled manner. Use a circular motion, starting from the center and moving outward, to maintain even extraction.
Pour in pulses or continuously, depending on preference: some suggest three pours (Bean Box, 50g bloom, then 125g, then rest), others multiple small pours (Low Key Coffee Snobs, 50-100mL pulses). Aim for a total pouring time of 3-4 minutes from the start of the bloom, as per Sample Coffee Roasters (3:30-4:00 minutes) and Whole Latte Love (3 minutes).
Ensure the coffee bed doesn't dry out between pours, adjusting pour rate to keep grounds submerged.
Serve the Coffee:
Once all water has drained (should slow to a drip in a few minutes), remove the V60 from the cup or server.
Swirl the coffee in the cup to mix and aerate, enhancing flavor, then serve and enjoy. Note any flavors brought out by the V60, such as clarity and brightness, especially with light to medium roasts (Bean Box).
Variations and Adjustments
The brewing process can be adjusted based on taste and equipment:
Grind Size: If the brew is too weak, grind finer; if too strong or bitter, grind coarser. Medium-fine to coarse is typical, with specific methods like Tetsu Kasuya’s 4:6 using coarser grinds for slower drainage (Smiling Coffee Snob).
Water Temperature: Higher for darker roasts (up to 205°F), lower for lighter (around 190°F), affecting extraction rate.
Bloom Water Amount: Varies significantly, from 1:1 coffee-to-water ratio (this guide, Whole Latte Love) to up to 5:1 (Low Key Coffee Snobs), impacting extraction balance. This guide uses 1:1 for simplicity.
Pouring Technique: Some methods involve stirring after pours (Smiling Coffee Snob), others rely on slow, methodical pours (Osmotic Flow, Smiling Coffee Snob), with videos for technique (Driftaway Coffee Video Reference).

Tips for Success
Use Fresh Coffee: Freshly roasted coffee enhances flavor, with CO2 release visible during bloom (Driftaway Coffee).
Adjust for Taste: If coffee is under-extracted (weak, sour), grind finer or increase contact time; if over-extracted (bitter), grind coarser or reduce time.
Clean Regularly: Hand wash with mild soap, use baking soda for stubborn residue (Bean Box).
Practice Makes Perfect: Brewing with the V60 requires attention, but practice improves consistency, as noted by Hario UK.
This comprehensive guide ensures you can brew a proper V60 coffee, with flexibility to adjust based on preference and equipment, drawing from a wide range of expert sources for a complete understanding.
